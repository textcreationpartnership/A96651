            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Readily embrace this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſalute you, wherein, as you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of fore-paſſed favours, together with the tender of my conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to ſo deſerving a friend; you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo perceive that wee move in <hi>Abington,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtraitneſſe of our orb, and meditate now and then ſome good turnes to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. I could look back, and tell you, that in froſty weather wee made bold to fetch two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred loads of wood from <hi>Bayly-wood,</hi> within
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113389:3"/>ſight of <hi>Oxford;</hi> and that there is not a day paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, wherein our commanded parties fetch not in proviſion from the enemies mouths, and fill our Gaols, beſides, out of pity, that they may crowd one another warme this late froſt. In fine, <hi>Oxford</hi> is pleaſed to connive at our continuall alarms, and ſuffer us to view their walls daily, within Muſquet-ſhot; if they ſee halfe a dozen honeſt Troopers face them, 'tis held a point of policy to ſuſpect a plot, an ambuſcado; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, well they may, if it be true, that the burnt childe dreads the fire. Now your <hi>Wallingford</hi> ſparks being not long ſince encouraged by the ſurprizall of three or four cloſe by <hi>Redding,</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured ſome better thoughts of their valour, as indeed not being ſo often cow'd as the other. But Major Generall <hi>Brown</hi> gives them all by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees a taſte of his vigilancie; for this very morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ordered Major <hi>Blundel</hi> to ſend a party of forty horſe to march up to <hi>Clifton</hi> and <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> thereby to ſecure our Markets, who in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone about two of the clock, were to go up to <hi>Benſon</hi> and <hi>Cromiſh,</hi> and ſo to give an alarm to <hi>Wallingford Caſtle,</hi> and if poſſible, draw out their horſe, who, if they ſhould iſſue forth,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113389:3"/>theſe forty horſe were to retreat. Major <hi>Blundel</hi> himſelfe was commanded to take an hundred more, and at an appointed hour to croſſe over at <hi>Chiſleton bridge,</hi> and ſo to come upon the reare of the enemy. The plot took, for Captain <hi>Roe,</hi> who commanded the firſt forty, drew out the enemy from <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and retreated in good order, till beyond <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> receiving now and then ſome ſleight charges, but at laſt appeared a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter body, and that of ſelect men, no worſe then all Officers and Reformades, being of the Kings own life-guard. Truly, then the retreat of ours proved an abſolute flight, the enemy doubling our number. Captain <hi>Roe,</hi> with thirty more of his Company, were taken priſoners, being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued eagerly as far as <hi>Clifton,</hi> within three miles of <hi>Abington.</hi> Theſe priſoners were conveying to <hi>Wallingford,</hi> when they were met by Major <hi>Blundel</hi> very oportunely (who obſerved his orders moſt punctually) ſo as that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately each priſoner ſeiſes upon his keeper. Major <hi>Blundel,</hi> now with the whole party, charges up to the body of the enemy, who were not farre before expecting none of us in their return home. There with eaſe wee noos'd them, amongſt us
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113389:4"/>took threeſcore horſe and more, and fifty priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereof the Governour at preſent, of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford</hi> was one, Lievt.

Lievt. Colonell <hi>Wilford,</hi> who commanded this party of theirs, was ſlaine upon the place, with three more of theirs, and one of ours. Lievt. Col. <hi>Lowre</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, he came forth of the Caſtle of purpoſe to hinder their purſuit of us too far, as ſuſpecting ſomething, but was not able to forbeare the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, till he was entrapt himſelf with his whole party.
